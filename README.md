## 30 Days of Streamlit
I participated in 30 Days of Streamlit on May 16, 2024, and finished it on May 29, 2024.

This challenge was amazingly profitable.

If there is anyone who wants to learn streamlit, I highly recommand this challenge.

## Application
Additionally, I built a web page for a survey.

If someone enters the site, votes, and submits, the result will be automatically stored in google spreadsheet.

**But, it is only available for those who have ID and password.**
